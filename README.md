# tinyCode_ticTacToe
Another tinyCode project - Create a Tic Tac Toe game

Incomplete as of 7/28/2020. Using TTT as a way to see how different programmers solve the same challenge. Prior to creating this project I figured out the basic log to check for a win
and was pleased to see it matched every other developer's win check logic. This was a facinating study in contrast between other developers.
